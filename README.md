# UXDCâ€™s Code of Conduct

## Short version
UXDC attendees, organizers, and sponsors are required to adhere to our Code of Conduct. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

If you need help, you can contact the organizer at luke.miller@natgeo.com

## Long version
UXDC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and/or UXDC community at large per the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Any aggressive behavior or commentary related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
* Harassing photography or recording
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report by contacting Steven Trevathan at the event or, if you cannot find an event organizer or are not comfortable contacting an event organizer in person, you can alternatively email luke.miller@natgeo.com
